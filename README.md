# FactorioSolver
Solver for factorio build constructions.

This project are meant to provide 3 primary functionalities:

1. Calculate (total- and intermediate-)material requirements based on the needed *throughput of any specific product* (hf. endproduct throughput).
2. Construct a flow network based on the construction and throughput of intermediate materials needed to sustain the endproduct throughput.
3. Construct a blueprint approximating the optimal factory that satisfies the endproduct throughput.
